<p> Sidewalks are a part of nearly every New York City neighborhood. Sidewalks provide a safe passageway for pedestrian movement and access to buildings, parks and other destinations. Per the NYC Department of Transportation, these “acceptable sidewalks” should be at least 5 feet wide, be ADA-compliant by featuring warning units or stone paving at intersections, and free of any imperfections such as cracked or uneven pavement, improper drainage, and trip hazards.  </p>

<body> <p> Data from the Mayor’s Office showcased that Community District 18 in Brooklyn has the lowest level of acceptable sidewalks as about 73% of sidewalks are not up-to-par. In 2023, there have been numerous incidents of "subsidence" or when the ground caves in, in residential homes in the Canarsie neighborhood. </p>

<p>
Beth Malone, the program director of the local Neighborhood Housing Services of Brooklyn, links these structural collapes to climate change. The change in sea levels and water levels heavily effect the poor quality soil which may be unstable and not be able to bear weight of concrete and construction, leading to cracked and dilapitated sidewalks in the district.</p>


<p>
    "We're gonna have a lot more of this stuff going on because of the rising water tables that are gonna be seeping in as a result of climate change," she said, "as a result of rising sea levels" </p>
